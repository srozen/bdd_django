## About

I'll be using two blog posts on this sample app :

- https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/setting-up-a-bdd-stack-on-a-django-application
- http://whoisnicoleharris.com/2015/03/19/bdd-part-two.html

The history and step-by-step implementation of the stack will be available
within the commits history.
